# **Binderly-Smart-Link**  
ðŸš€ **A Catalyst Project for Seamless School Integration**  

## **Overview**  
Binderly-Smart-Link is a service designed to run on **Raspberry Pi Zero W** devices, enhancing how schools communicate with students.  

### **Why This Project?**  
Many schools use the **Binderly** app to share important updates like flyers, events, and announcements. However, **students rarely check the app**, leading to missed information.  

Binderly-Smart-Link solves this problem by:  
âœ… **Displaying school updates** on easy-to-view digital kiosks.  
âœ… **Reducing flyer clutter** in school hallways.  
âœ… **Ensuring students stay informed** without needing to open an app.

## **Installation**  
To install Binderly-Smart-Link, simply run:  
```bash
./BinderlyInstall.sh
```

This script will handle all dependencies and setup for your Raspberry Pi.  

---

## **How It Works**  
- The service pulls real-time updates from **Binderly**.  
- It launches **Chromium in kiosk mode**, displaying announcements on the Raspberry Pi screen.  
- Schools can place these digital displays in hallways, libraries, and common areas.

## **Requirements**  
- **Raspberry Pi Zero W** (or any compatible Pi model)  
- **Binderly API access**  
- **Internet connection**
